# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by (Robert Gonpou Mesleh Jr)


## Dataset

The Ford GoBike dataset containes ride information about 183,412 trips made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The datases contians trip information such as the date, duration, gender, birth year, and more. The dataset data can be found [here].


## Summary of Findings

I found in the exploration that the most of the rides San Francisco Bay area were taken by males, people with younger age, and were taken during weekdays (from Monday to Friday, mostly on Thurday). The most rides were also start 8:00am and 6:00pm. In terms of the duration of the trips, women rode for a longer duation than men whereas there was no correlation found between year of birth and ride duration. 

Outside of the key variables of interest, it is noteworthy to mention that weekends days (Saturday and Sunday) had the longest ride durations, and riders with with 24-hour or 3-day pass spent longer time riding on average than riders with annual subscriptions.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For my insight, I would be focusing entirely on how long do San Francisco Bay bikers ride, and when most rides are taken. I would begin with demography of the bikers to get a general idea about the population, their gender and types, using a number charts. I would then proceed to the main varialbe of interest and how it compares with (and across) other variables in the analysis.
